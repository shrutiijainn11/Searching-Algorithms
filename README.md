# Searching-Algorithms
Different searching algorithms implementation in java

Algorithms included:

Linear Search
Description: It sequentially checks each element of the list until it finds the target value or reaches the end.
Time Complexity:
Best case: O(1) (if the target is the first element)
Average/Worst case: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Key Points:
Simple but inefficient for large datasets.
Works on both unsorted and sorted arrays.
Useful when the dataset is small or unsorted.
3. Binary Search
